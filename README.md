Respecting the hustle in the Far Future

## Idea:

A text-based star-faring sandbox role-playing game in which the player controls a merchant ship and it's crew, and can travel from start port to star port buying and selling randomly generated trade-goods in an attempt to Get Rich (or at least make their ship's mortgage payments).

### Setting
A portion of a map generated by my Traveller sector generator and random name generator.

### Structure

- Prompt for Crew Size (difficulty slider of a sort)
- Randomly generate crew
- Choice between bigger, slower or smaller, faster ship
- Start in a starport with randomly generated trade goods
- Purchase trade goods, pay maintenance and mortgage costs for ship, pick a nearby system within ships current jump range, repeat until broke or bored

### Features
- Random events in port or in travel that check against crew skills
- Ability to upgrade ship cargo space and travel distance?
